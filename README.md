## rdflib.types

This repostitory contributes a [Scala-JS](https://www.scala-js.org) facade ([doc](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/interoperability/facade-types.html))
for the [rdflib.js](https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js/) javascript+typesecript
library.

### Typings

We use the [Scalably Typed](https://scalablytyped.org/docs/usage) project 
to automate the translation of scala-js. 
See the 2019 talk [Intro to Scalably Typed](https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1442397601920212996)
for a good overview. Note that since then Scala3 has
come out, and that should make a big difference.
